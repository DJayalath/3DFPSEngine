- Entities extremely inefficient for multiple identical models - fix this!
- Block placing system:
	- How is each island stored? Each island = 1 file?
	- How are blocks handled? Size relative to player? Scaling? How are they placed together?
	- Starting configuration when player spawns?
IMPORTANT: What's the point? What is the game?
	- Outer space bases?
	- How are resources aquired? XP system? Attacking other bases?
	- Like Minecraft factions?
	- Base defense systems? (Remember voltz? ICBMs, ballistics but space themed?)
